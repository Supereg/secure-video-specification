# HomeKit Secure Video Unofficial Specification

## 1. Overview

### Service Definitions

#### Cameras

HomeKit Secure-Video cameras need to expose the same services as normal cameras with the following changes: 

* Every `RTPStreamManagement` service must add the `Active` characteristic
(This is used to indicate that the camera is fully turned off)
* The required amount of `RTPStreamManagement` services was dropped down from two to one.
* The `MotionSensor` service is required (to indicate movement and thus a start and stop of a recording)
* The `CameraOperatingMode` service is required
* The `DataStreamManagement` service is required (to initiate HomeKit Data Stream communication)
* The `CameraRecordingManagement` service is required. It needs to link to the `MotionSensor` and `DataStreamManagement` service

#### Doorbells

HomeKit Secure-Video doorbells need to expose the same services as both doorbells and secure-video cameras.

### Active states

Every Secure-Video enabled camera can be set to four different states: `Off`, `Detect Activity`, `Stream`
and `Stream & Allow Recording`.  
Depending on the state the following `Active` characteristics for the given services are set.

| Camera-States            | RTPStreamManagement `Active` | CameraOperatingMode `HomeKitCameraActive` | CameraRecordingManagement `Active` | 
| :----------------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Off                      | false | false | false |
| Detect Activity          | false  | true | false |
| Stream                   | true  | true  | false |
| Stream & Allow Recording | true  | true  | true  |

### Recording requirements

* The camera needs so support basic motion detection
* The camera needs to support encoding, buffering and transmitting of fragmented MP4 - Pretty similar to Section 3.3 
[RFC 8216](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216#section-3.3) (HLS). The RFC refers to
[ISO/IEC 14496-12 ISO base media file format](https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-4/iso-base-media-file-format/text-isoiec-14496-12-5th-edition).  
How exactly the data is transmitted can be read
in the [HDS Packet Formats](#4-homekit-data-stream-packet-formats) section and the [Flow of events](#5-flow-of-events)
section.
* Supported video codecs are: h.264, h.265 (possibly)
* Supported audio codecs are: AAC-LC, AAC-ELD
* Supported resolutions:
    * 640x480
    * 1024x768
    * 1280x960
    * 2048x1536
    * 640x360
    * 1280x720
    * 1920x1080
    * 3840x2160 (not implemented)
    * 720x1280
    * 1080x1920
    * 1600x1200
    * 1440x1080
    * 1200x1600
    * 1080x1440
    * 960x1280
    * 768x1024

## 4. HomeKit Data Stream Packet Formats
### 4.1 Start

When the camera detects motion it will send an hap event for the characteristic as usual.
After that one of the connected Home Hubs will send a open request.

The header should use `dataSend` as the protocol and `open` as the topic.  
The **request** has the following message fields:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| target | string | `home hub` - to signify the direction of the send |
| type | string | `ipcamera.recording` - the type of the stream |
| streamId | int | used to identify this stream; chosen by the home hub |

The **response** has the following message fields:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| status | int | Indicates if stream could be opened. Available codes are unknown: <br> 0 - Success |

### 4.2 Binary Data

The header should use `dataSend` as the protocol and `data` as the topic.
The **event** has the following message fields:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| streamId | int | Same identifier used in the dataSend.open |
| packets | array | Array of dictionaries. Usually length = 1 |

A packet dictionary looks like the following:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| data | bytes | Packet data |
| metadata | dictionary | Metadata for the packet |

Metadata for recording chunks is defined as:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| dataType | string | `mediaInitialization` - for the first event message which contains mp4 initializing `ftyp` and `moof` boxes <br> `mediaFragment` - for all other packets which contains fragmented mp4 segments |
| dataSequenceNumber | int | Starting by `1` (with the mediaInitialization packet) and incrementing for every mp4 segment |
| dataChunkSequenceNumber | int | Starting by `1`; enumerates every data chunk of a mp4 segment (if a mp4 segment is to big it can be split in multiple packets using this chunk number) |
| isLastDataChunk | boolean | `true` when the data chunk is the last for the current sequence/mp4 segment |

### 4.3 Close

This event closes the stream and is sent by the home hub once the motion sensor is set back to "No motion detected"
(It seems that the home hub still waits for the last mp4 segment to be sent).  
The header should use `dataSend` as the protocol and `close` as the topic.

The **event** has the following message fields:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| streamId | int | Same identifier used in the dataSend.open |
| reason | int | Example reasons: <br> 0 - Normal - Normal Close <br> 1 - Not Allowed - Home hub will not allow the Accessory to send this transfer <br> 2 - Busy - Home hub cannot accept this transfer right now <br> 3 - Cancelled - Accessory will not finish the transfer <br> 4 - Unsupported - Home hub does not support this stream type <br> 5 - Unexpected Failure - Some other protocol error occurred and the stream has failed <br> 6 - Timeout - Accessory could not start the session |

The accessory can also send this event message to indicate that the session errored unexpectedly and should be aborted.

## 5. Flow of events

In this section I will give a brief overlook on how an activity will be recorded using secure-video.

* The secure-video camera gets paired.
* All available Home Hubs will open an HomeKit Data Stream Connection to the accessory
* The user sets the current [camera state](#active-states) to `Stream & Allow Recording`
* The configuration of the camera will be set up:
    * The accessory will receive a write request on the
      [SelectedCameraRecordingConfiguration](#311-selectedcamerarecordingconfiguration) characteristic
        * Important settings like the `prebuffer length` are configured
    * The `Active` characteristic of the [CameraRecordingManagement](#22-camerarecordingmanagement) service will be
        set to true (and all other active characteristics getting updated according to the [camera state](#active-states))
* If the camera is set to detect motion it will continuously check the video stream for any movement as usual.
If recording is enabled the camera will fill the pre buffer with mp4 fragments according to the First-In-Last-Out principle.
* If the camera detects motion (analogous for doorbell button presses) if will set the `Motion Detected` characteristic
of the `Motion Sensor` to true
    * After that a home hub will initiate a bulk send session over HDS and sends a [`dataSend` `start` request](#41-start)
    with a new streamId
    * The camera will now send a [mediaInitialization](#42-binary-data) `dataSend` `data` event with the below listed metadata.
    The mp4 data contains a `ftyp` and `moov` box.
        * `dataSequenceNumber`: 1
        * `dataChunkSequenceNumber`: 1
        * `isLastDataChunk`: true
    * After that the actual mp4 fragments are getting sent using [mediaFragment](#42-binary-data) `dataSend` `data` events.
    The mp4 data contains a `moof` and a `mdata` box and must start with a keyframe.
    The accessory will begin immediately by sending the fragments currently contained in the prebuffer (typically 2x4 seconds in length).
    After that the accessory will send any newly recorded mp4 fragments (typically 4s in length) when they become available
    (any fragment will be sent, where the recording was started while motion was still detected).  
    Every mp4 fragment gets a new incrementally assigned `dataSequenceNumber` (starting by 2 for the first segment in the preBuffer).
    If the size of one mp4 fragment is too big it can be split into multiple chunks. Then every chunk is enumerated
    by the `dataChunkSequenceNumber`, while the last chunk must always be marked with `isLastDataChunk` equal to true.
    Current cameras seems to use a **maximum chunk size of 262,144 bytes** (or 0x40000 bytes).
* The HomeKit Home Hub receiving the mp4 fragments will analyze every mp4 fragment for moving objects, recognize faces, and decide,
according to the configured motion settings, if a given fragment will be flagged for motion or not.
The Home Hub will then assemble a recording from the flagged mp4 fragments and save it in iCloud. 
iCloud will then tell iPhones, iPads, HomePods and AppleTV to notify the user based on their notification settings.  
* When motion stops the accessory will set the `Motion Detected` characteristic  of the `Motion Sensor` to false.
The camera will still send out the last mp4 fragment which is currently recorded (remember: typically fixed 4s fragment length).
After a short time the Home Hub will send a [`dataSend` `close` event](#43-close) to indicate that the given 
transmission for the `streamId` is closed.

Example fmp4 files of an transmitted recording can be found in the [examples](./examples) directory.
Additionally a full writeup of the transmitted HomeKit Data Stream payloads for the given example can be found 
[here](./examples/README.md).
